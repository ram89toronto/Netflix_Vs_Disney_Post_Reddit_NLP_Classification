### Description


Goal of the Project
1. Using [Pushshift's](https://github.com/pushshift/api) API, you'll collect posts from two subreddits of your choosing.
2. You'll then use NLP to train a classifier on which subreddit a given post came from. This is a binary classification problem.


#### About the API

Pushshift's API is fairly straightforward. For example, if I want the posts from [`/r/boardgames`](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames), all I have to do is use the following url: https://api.pushshift.io/reddit/search/submission?subreddit=boardgames


**NOTE:** Pushshift now limits you to 100 posts per request (no longer the 500 in the screencast).

### Requirements

- Gather and prepare data using the `requests` library.
- **Create and compare three models**. One of these must be a Random Forest classifier, however the other two can be a classifier of your choosing: logistic regression, KNN, SVM, etc.
- A Jupyter Notebook with your analysis for a peer audience of data scientists.
- An executive summary of your results.
- A short presentation outlining your process and findings for a semi-technical audience.






This project covers three of the biggest concepts we cover in the class: Classification Modeling, Natural Language Processing and Data Wrangling/Acquisition.

Part 1 of the project focuses on **Data wrangling/gathering/acquisition**. This is a very important skill as not all the data you need will be in clean CSVs or a single table in SQL.  There is a good chance that wherever you land you will have to gather some data from some unstructured/semi-structured sources; when possible, requesting information from an API, but often scraping it because they don't have an API (or it's terribly documented).

Part 2 of the project focuses on **Natural Language Processing** and converting standard text data (like Titles and Comments) into a format that allows us to analyze it and use it in modeling.

Part 3 of the project focuses on **Classification Modeling**.  Given that project 2 was a regression focused problem, we needed to give you a classification focused problem to practice the various models, means of assessment and preprocessing associated with classification.
